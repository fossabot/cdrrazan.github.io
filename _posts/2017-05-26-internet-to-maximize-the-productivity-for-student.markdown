Internet is one of the finest friend it can be yet so dangerous on the other side. Connecting on one side of the world to another side of the world isn't one major but minor of thousands of the advantages it can be in the today's world. Different people can use internet for different use. It matters according to the profession. However in this blog article i am going to write about the internet and student and how they can make use of.

As a student, what things can be generally needed for? Obviously reading, writing. However these are generalized content because believe me student are nothing but a load of things which they do. So for different things, it is almost impossible to connect on one network. Below are some of the social network and  services student can use to maximize their productivity on the basis of my usage and experience.


## A. Social Network

Social network are foremost for students. These days a lot of social network are in the internet but not all are applicable for students. Beside personal use, if someone wants to use social network either for sole or collaboration purpose, i recommend following social network or sites. It is not necessary to have account or make on but you can according to your use and need based on what activities you and your group in the college do.

Even though there are various social network for students, sometimes we need to send email because of the attachments. Even though mail exchange have been thin in the air but they are still in relevant.

Use one of email Provider such as <b>Google, Outlook, hotmail, yahoo mail</b> etc.

File Collaboration is the major platform because sometimes discussion, email may not be enough. Hence file collaboration is much needed part for the student. It means interacting with the file kept in cloud location. We can use services such as Google drive, One drive, Dropbox, Box etc. Recently this happened to be much beneficial as i was able to share some of the files through Google Drive to my colleagues preparing for the exam.

### Popular Cloud storage Application and their Storage:

Google Drive: 15 GB

One drive: 5GB

Box: 10GB

Dropbox: 3GB

Recommendation: <b>Google drive</b>

Once you have a Google account, you can automatically login and use 15 GB. You can use it store files, photos. You can store files and make it shareable so that your friends can access and download it.


## D. QnA forum
QnA forum means asking question and answering by experts or other user. Asking questions on the other hand may be related to all field either mathematics or programming. Their may be many sites but my best recommendation is Stack Exchange Network. You can enter into various sub networks and solve your question and ask if you have anything new.


Other: <b>Quora and Reddit</b> recommended.


## E. Chat and Discussion

Although social media provide this feature not every people you can get into touch with them because of privacy and other issue. Hence you can get in touch with other experts and seniors in chat and discussion site or app who don't want to disclose on such social network for personal cause.

Recommended: <b>Slack, Discord, Gitter</b> [ According to need]

## F. Code sharing and Collaboration
